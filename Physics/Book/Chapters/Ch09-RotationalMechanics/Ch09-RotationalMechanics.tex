	\section{Angular Velocity and Acceleration}
	An object that is spinning can be described using angular velocity and angular acceleration.  Angular velocity is a way of expressing how much an object rotates in a given time.  It could be measured in Rotations per Minute (rpms), Degrees per hour, or any other measurement of an angle divided by any measurement of time.  However, it is advantageous to use Radians per Second.
	
	  Just like velocity measures how fast an object is moving in a line, angular velocity measures how fast an object is rotating.    Average ngular velocity is given by the following equation:
	  	\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=orange!20!white]
	  \begin{equation}
		\vec{\omega}_{avg} = \frac{\Delta \vec{\theta}}{\Delta t}
	  \end{equation}
	\end{mdframed}
	and instantaneous angular velocity is given by: 
	  	\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=orange!20!white]
	\begin{equation}
	\vec{\omega} = \frac{d \vec{\theta}}{d t}
	\end{equation}
\end{mdframed}
