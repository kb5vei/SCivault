  You may have heard Sir Isaac Newton's first law of physics stated in different ways than the above.  Often in grade school, students are taught a phrase beginning with ``objects in motion...''.  	Sometimes this law is called the ``Law of Inertia''.   This is a very basic understanding of the complexity of this law.  In fact, all non-accelerating systems are governed by this law.  As long as the vector sum of the forces upon an object is zero, the object will continue in a state of uniform motion (remaining at rest is a type of uniform motion) until something causes the equilibrium of the system to be lost.  
	Likewise, if an object is known to have an acceleration of zero, we can state that the vector sum of the forces is equal to zero.  We can use this law to characterize non-accelerating systems:

		\begin{equation}
			\Sigma \vec{F} = 0  
			\label{eqn:newtonsfirst}
		\end{equation}

Newton's Second Law describes objects and systems that have a constant acceleration.  The vector sum of the forces on an object is equal to the object's mass times its acceleration:

	\section{Applications of Newton's Laws}
		\subsection{Friction}
		\index{Friction}
		\textbf{Friction} occurs whenever two surfaces are in contact, and it is a force that has two effects.  
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Friction always opposes the motion of an object, or even the tendency to move.
			\item Friction dissipates energy into heat.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\index{Friction, static} \index{Friction, kinetic}
		There are two types of friction that one should know about: \textbf{static friction} and \textbf{kinetic friction}.  Static friction is present when two surfaces are in contact, but not sliding.  Kinetic friction is occurs when two surfaces are in contact and sliding past each other.  One should note that when an object is rolling, there is static friction between the outer edge of the wheel and the surface it is rolling on, whereas static or kinetic friction may be present where the wheel is connected to the axle, depending on the type of joint that is used.  
		
		\index{Coefficient of Friction}
		The \textbf{coefficient of static friction}  and the \textbf{coefficient of kinetic friction}, symbolized by $\mu_s$ and $\mu_k$ respectively, measure how hard it is to slide two surfaces past each other.  A surface that is very slippery will have low coefficients of friction, whereas surfaces that grip each other well will very high coefficients of friction. A perfectly frictionless surface would have a coefficient of friction of 0.  Some examples of coefficients of friction can be found in \color{red} insert reference here\color{black}.  One should also note that the coefficients of friction are unitless.  
		
		To calculate the force of static friction, the following formula is used:
		\index{Static Friction}
		\index{Friction, Static}
		\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=orange!20!white]
			\begin{equation}
				|F_f| \leq \mu_s |F_N|  
				\label{eqn:frictionstatic}
			\end{equation}
		\end{mdframed}
	
	The force of kinetic friction can be calculated by using this formula:
			\index{Friction, Kinetic}
			\index{Kinetic Friction}
			\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=orange!20!white]
		\begin{equation}
			|F_f| = \mu_k |F_N|  
			\label{eqn:frictionkinetic}
		\end{equation}
