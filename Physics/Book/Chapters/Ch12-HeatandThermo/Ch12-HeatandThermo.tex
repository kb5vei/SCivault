	\textit{Heat} is thermal energy that is transferred from one object to another.  Most often, heat energy is symbolized by the variable $Q$.  
	\section{Modes of Heat Transfer}
	\index{Heat Transfer. Modes of}
	There are three modes in which heat is transferred from one object to another.   \begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Conduction} occurs when objects are physically touching each other.  Metals tend to be good conductors of heat. 
		\item   \textit{Convection} occurs when a moving fluid causes heat to be transferred.  Convection currents in fluids can occur naturally, or they can be forced. 
		\item  \textit{Thermal Radiation} (not to be confused with Ionizing Radiation, which will be studied in chapter \ref{chap:nuclear}) occurs when heat is transferred via electromagnetic waves.  While infrared light is most often associated with heat transfer, all electromagnetic rays transfer energy - and that energy often ends up as thermal energy.  
		\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Laws of Thermodynamics}
	\index{Thermodynamics}
	
	There are a total of four laws of thermodynamics.  Each law of thermodynamics focuses on a particular aspect of how heat can be transferred. 
	
	\subsection{0th Law}
		\index{Thermodynamics, 0th Law of}
	
	The 0th law of thermodynamics deals with the idea of thermal equilibrium.  Let us suppose there are three objects: A, B, and C, and each object has a temperature, $T_A$, $T_B$, and $T_C$, respectively.  If $T_A = T_B$ and $T_B = T_C$, then $T_A = T_C$.  
	
	While this may seem to go without saying, it is important to realize the implications of this law.  First, when objects are in thermal equilibrium (at the same temperature), no heat will flow.  Second, heat energy is fungible, meaning that all heat enery is the same and will have the same effect on the temperature of an object, despite the origin or process that delivers that thermal energy to an object.
