\chapter{Heat and Thermodynamics}
	\textit{Heat} is thermal energy that is transferred from one object to another.  Most often, heat energy is symbolized by the variable $Q$.  
	\section{Modes of Heat Transfer}
	\index{Heat Transfer. Modes of}
	There are three modes in which heat is transferred from one object to another.   \begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Conduction} occurs when objects are physically touching each other.  Metals tend to be good conductors of heat. 
		\item   \textit{Convection} occurs when a moving fluid causes heat to be transferred.  Convections currents in fluids can occur naturally, or they can be forced. 
		\item  \textit{Thermal Radiation} (not to be confused with Ionizing Radiation, which will be studied in chapter \ref{chap:nuclear}) occurs when heat is transferred via electromagnetic waves.  While infrared light is most often associated with heat transfer, all electromagnetic rays transfer energy - and that energy often ends up as thermal energy.
