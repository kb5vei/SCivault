	\section{Lenz's Law}
	
	Lenz's law states that in the presence of a changing magnetic field, a current will flow in a loop that generates a magnetic field opposite to the direction of the change.  
	
	
	Several examples are shown below:

		\textbf{Problem: }A square of metal is located along the same plane as the page.  A magnetic field is directed into the page, and is getting stronger.  In what direction will current flow?  
		
		\textbf{Solution:} We begin by drawing a diagram:
		
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw (0,0) -- (4,0) -- (4,4) -- (0,4) -- (0,0);
		\node at (-1,-1) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};
		\node at (-1,1) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};		
		\node at (-1,3) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};
		\node at (-1,5) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};		
		\node at (1,-1) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};
		\node at (1,1) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};		
		\node at (1,3) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};
		\node at (1,5) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};			
		\node at (3,-1) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};
		\node at (3,1) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};		
		\node at (3,3) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};
		\node at (3,5) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};					
		\node at (5,-1) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};
		\node at (5,1) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};		
		\node at (5,3) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};
		\node at (5,5) (nodeS) {$\bigotimes$};	
				
			\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{center}
		
Since the magnetic field is getting stronger, the current induced will oppose this change by creating a magnetic field directed out of the page (thereby cancelling some of the growing strength).  Using the third right hand rule, current will flow counterclockwise, as shown below: 
	
	
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw (0,0) -- (4,0) -- (4,4) -- (0,4) -- (0,0);
	
		\node at (4,2) (nodeS) {$\uparrow$};	
		\node at (2,4) (nodeS) {$\leftarrow$};
		\node at (2,0) (nodeS) {$\rightarrow$};		
		\node at (0,2) (nodeS) {$\downarrow$};				
		
	
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
