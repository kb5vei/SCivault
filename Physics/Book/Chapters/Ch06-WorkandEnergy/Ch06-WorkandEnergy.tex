	While all real springs convert mechanical energy into heat when stretching or compressing, the amount of energy lost as heat (a process called hysteresis) is usually negligible.  However, some stretchable objects, such as rubber bands, lose significant amounts of energy as heat.  Thus, equations \ref{eqn:hookeslaw} and \ref{eqn:elasticpotentialenergy} are not applicable to these objects.  
	
	\section{The Work-Energy Theorem}
	The \textit{Work-Energy Theorem} states that doing work on an object causes that object's energy to change by the same amount as the work done.  This means that an object has 8 Joules of energy, and 2 Joules of work is done on the object, the object will have 10 Joules of work at the end of the process.  	While this is often associated with a change in kinetic energy, the energy change associated with work can also be associated with gravitational potential energy, thermal energy, or any other form of energy.  
	
	\section{The Law of Conservation of Energy}
	States that Energy cannot be created or destroyed (this isn't entirely true.  This law will be tweaked in chapter \color{red} INSERT REFERENCE HERE. \color{black}

	\section{Pendulums}
	A pendulum is any weight on the end of an arm that is free to swing back and forth.  You may have seen pendulums in old-fashioned clocks, and the swings at a park also act like a pendulum.  When a pendulum swings at a small angle ($\theta \lessapprox 5 \deg)$, the period of a pendulum is given by:
	
	\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=orange!20!white]
		\begin{equation}
			T_p = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}
			\label{eqn:pendulumperiod}
		\end{equation}
	\end{mdframed}
	
	Notice that the period of a pendulum does not depend on the mass of the bob.  The only two variables that affect its period (assuming a small angle) are the length of the arm and gravity.
