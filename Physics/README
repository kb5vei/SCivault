The Physics folder contains three subfolders:

-Advanced Physics - These are files that may be useful for Honors/AP/IB Physics classes.  They are taylored toward AP Physics 1 and 2,
		    but may be useful for other courses.

-General Physics - These are files that are taylored toward a general-education, high-school level physics course.

-Obsolete - There are resources that the author created for use in his Pre-AP and AP Physics B courses.
	    They are provided for use at the disgression of the instructor.  Note that these files will 
	    likely need to be adapted to different levels of rigor or specificity.
