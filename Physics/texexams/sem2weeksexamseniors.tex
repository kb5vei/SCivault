	\begin{question}
	A planet is found that is the exact same mass as Earth, and has all the conditions needed to support life, (oxygen, water, sunlight, etc) but there is no life on the planet.  An astronaut plants some grass and drops off some cows and bull.  Over the next thousand years, the grass grows and the cows reproduce.  If no other trips are made to visit the planet, the total mass of this planet (including the mass of the cows and the grass)
		\choice{Increases as the grass grows and the cows reproduce.}
		\choice[!]{Remains constant due to the law of conservation of mass.}
		\choice{Decreases due to the cows eating the grass.}
		\choice{Could increase, decrease, or remain the same depending on the final number of cows and total amount of grass after 1000 years.}
	\end{question}

	


	\begin{question}

\begin{question}

You are attempting to loosen a bolt from your car by putting a force on a wrench, as shown in the picture.   You can choose to put a force on the wrench at point A or at point B.  If both the forces are the same magnitude, which force is more effective in loosening the bolt?
\choice{Force A is more likely to turn the bolt because the force is applied closer to the bolt.}
\choice{Force A is more likely to turn the bolt because $\frac{F_A}{r}$ is greater than $\frac{F_B}{r}$.}
\choice{Force B is more likely to turn the bolt because FB has a larger magnitude.}
\choice[!]{Force B is more likely to turn the bolt because it produces a greater torque.}
\choice{Both forces will turn the bolt in the same manner because the magnitude of both forces is the same.}
\end{question}
