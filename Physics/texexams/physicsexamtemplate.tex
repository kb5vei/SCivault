	\begin{question}
		The space probe Deep Space 1, was launched on October 24, 1998.  It was the first space probe to use an ion engine, that only generates a weak force of 0.056 N, but requires very little fuel.  The probe has a mass of \word{{474 kg} {464 kg} {484kg}{494kg}}.  The engine ran for a long time, causing the probe to move a distance of 2 billion meters.  Assume that the mass of the probe does not change, and no other forces act on the probe.  What is the final speed of the probe?
