	A planet is found that is the exact same mass as Earth, and has all the conditions needed to support life, (oxygen, water, sunlight, etc) but there is no life on the planet.  An astronaut plants some grass and drops off some cows and bull.  Over the next thousand years, the grass grows and the cows reproduce.
