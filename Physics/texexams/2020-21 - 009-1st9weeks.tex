\begin{question}
A train is traveling to the right with a constant speed $v_t$.  Two identical spheres are rolling on the floor of one train car.  In the frame of reference of the train, the spheres are moving directly toward each other with a speed $v_p$, parallel to the train's motion, as shown in the figure above.  A person is standing outside the train as it passes by.  What are the velocities that the person would measure of each of the spheres as the train passes by?

A lion is running at a constant speed toward a gazelle that is standing still, as shown in the top figure.  After several seconds, the gazelle notices the lion and accelerates directly toward him, hoping to pass the lion and force him to reverse direction.
