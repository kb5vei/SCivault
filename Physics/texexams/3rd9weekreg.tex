Answer each of the following questions in a well-written paragraph of at least\textbf{ 5 sentences.}  
	\begin{question}
	Before being shot, a gun and a bullet have 0 kg m/s of momentum.  When the gun is shot, both the bullet and the gun have momentum (the bullet travels forward at high speed, and the gun travels backward at a much lower speed.).  How can this be if momentum cannot be created or destroyed?
