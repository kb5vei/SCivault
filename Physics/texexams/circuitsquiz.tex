\begin{multiplechoice} [title={Multiple Choice},

	\textit{Choose the best answer to each question.} 
	
	\begin{question}
	 Are charges used up in the production of light in a light bulb?
	 \choice {Yes, charge is used up. Charges moving through the filament produce ``friction" which heats up the filament and produces light.}
	 \choice {Yes, charge is used up. Charges are emitted as photons and are lost.}
	 \choice {Yes, charge is used up. Charges are absorbed by the filament and are lost.}
	 \choice {No, charge is conserved. Charges are simply converted to another form such as heat and light.}
	 \choice[!]{ No, charge is conserved. Charges moving through the filament produce ``friction" which heats up the filament and produces light.}
	\end{question}

	\begin{question}
	How does the power delivered to resistor A change when resistor B is added to the circuit? (Both resistors are the same resistance.)

	
		\includegraphics[width=7cm]{"./c1".png}
	\choice {The power quadruples.}
	\choice {The power doubles}
	\choice {The power stays the same.}
	\choice {The power is reduced by half.}
	\choice[!]{The power is reduced to one quarter.}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
	Why do the lights in your home come on almost instantaneously when you turn on the switch?
	\choice{When the circuit is completed, there is a rapid rearrangement of surface charges in the circuit.}
	\choice{Charges store energy. When the circuit is completed, the energy is released.}
	\choice{Charges in the wire travel very fast.}
	\choice{The circuits in a home are wired in parallel. Thus, a current is already flowing.}
	\choice[!]{Charges in the wire are like marbles in a tube. When the circuit is completed, the charges push each other through the wire.}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
	The amount of charge that flows through a point on a wire per unit of time is called - 
		\choice{Voltage}
		\choice{Power}
		\choice[!]{Current}
		\choice{Resistance}
		\choice{Energy}	
\end{question}

\begin{question}
	A circuit that does not have a complete path between the two sides of the source is called -

		\choice{Closed}
		\choice{Short}
		\choice{interrupted}
		\choice{Parallel}
