	\begin{question}
A blue sphere and a red sphere with the same diameter are released from rest at the top of a ramp. The red sphere takes a longer time to reach the bottom of the ramp. The spheres are then rolled off a horizontal table at the same time with the same speed and fall freely to the floor. Which sphere reaches the floor first?

An object is moving to the west at a constant speed. Three forces are exerted on the object. One force is 15 N directed due north, and another is 15 N directed due west. What is the magnitude and direction of the third force if the object is to continue moving to the west at a constant speed?

\begin{question}
A box with a weight of 50N is at rest on a horizontal surface. The coefficient of static friction between the box and the surface is 0.40, and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.20.

\begin{question}
A spacecraft is drifting through space at a constant velocity.  Suddenly, a gas leak in the side of the spacecraft gives it a constant acceleration in a direction perpendicular to the original velocity.  The orientation of the spacecraft does not change, so the acceleration remains perpendicular to the original direction of the velocity.  What is the shape of the path the spacecraft moves along?

	The Voyager 2 Spacecraft was launched on August 20 1977.  It flew past the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

If it is left alone, it will pass close to the star Sirius in the year 298,000.  Which of Newton's Laws best explains why Voyager 2 continues to travel farther from the earth?
