	The following information is for questions 1-2:
	
	
		\includegraphics[height=2cm]{foxtrot.jpg}
		
Three identical blocks each take a different path from a height h to the ground.  Block A is released from rest and falls vertically.  Block B is released from rest and slides down a frictionless incline.  Block C is projected horizontally with an initial speed v.  
	

\begin{question}
Which block takes the longest time to reach the ground?
\choice{Block A}
\choice{Block B}
\choice{Block C}
\choice{All three blocks reach the ground at the same time.}

	\end{question}

\begin{question}
Which block has the greatest speed just before it hits the ground?
\choice{Block A}
\choice{Block B}
\choice{Block C}
\choice{All three blocks have the same speed just before they hit the ground.}
	\end{question}

\begin{question}
The figure below shows the path of a stunt-car as it drives off a cliff.  Compared to the horizontal component of the car's velocity at point A, the horizontal component of the car's velocity at point B is -
