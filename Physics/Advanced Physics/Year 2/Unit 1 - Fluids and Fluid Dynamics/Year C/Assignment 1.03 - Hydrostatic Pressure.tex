\begin{center}Assignment 1.03: Hydrostatic Pressure
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A laptop computer has an area of 0.02 m2 and a mass of 1.25 kg. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is the weight of the laptop?
		\vspace{0.5in}
		\item What is the pressure the laptop exerts on the desk?
		\vspace{0.5in}
	\end{enumerate}
	


	\item You push your friend's arm with a force of 20 newtons.  What is the pressure when - 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item the force is applied using your hand (A=0.02 m\textsuperscript{2})?
				\vspace{0.5in}
		
			\item the force is applied using a needle with a radius of 0.5 mm?
			\vspace{0.5in}
		\end{enumerate}


	\item A tank of water is cylindrical, with a radius of 2 meters, and it is filled to a depth of 4.5 meters.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item What is the gauge pressure at the bottom of the tank?
			\vspace{0.5in}
			
			
			
			
			\item What is the absolute pressure at the bottom of the tank?
			\vspace{0.5in}
			
			
			
			
		\end{enumerate}
 
	\item The titanic lies under the north Atlantic ocean under approximately 3800 meters of ocean water.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is the (absolute) pressure at this depth? 
		\vspace{0.75 in}
		
		
		\item A submarine has a window with an area of 2 m\textsuperscript{2}.  What amount of force should this window be able to withstand in order to dive to the Titanic's depth?  
			\vspace{0.75 in}
	
	\end{enumerate}

\newpage
	\item Chris is diving in the ocean, where he feels a pressure of 8.3 x 10\textsuperscript{6} Pa.  How far below the surface of the ocean is he?  (Use 1020 kg/m\textsuperscript{3} for the density of ocean water.)
	\vspace{1.5in}
	
	
	\item Saturn's moon, Titan has an acceleration due to gravity of 1.352 m/s\textsuperscript{2}, and is covered in lakes of liquid methane.  Liquid methane has a density of 422.36 kg /m\textsuperscript{3}.  If an astronaut's suit is designed to withstand 2.34 x 10\textsuperscript{6} Pa of pressure, how deep into a lake can the astronaut go?
	
	\vspace{1.5in}
	
	\item In the 2003 movie \textit{The Core}, a ship attempts to journey to the center of the Earth by traveling through the mantle of the Earth.  Magma has an average density of approximately 2500 kg/m\textsuperscript{3} (though it does get denser as you go deeper into the mantle).  Assume the ship is engineered to withstand pressures 1 million times greater than atmospheric pressure. In a clear, coherent paragraph, explain the likelihood that this ship will be able to complete its mission, and the reason why or why not.
