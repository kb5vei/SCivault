\begin{center}Assignment 1.03: Fluid Continuity
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Water flows in a pipe of radius 2 cm at a speed of 1 m/s.  The water then enters a thinner pipe, with a radius of 1 cm.  What is the speed of the water in the thinner pipe?
\vspace{1.2in}

\item A water tank springs a leak in the bottom, and water begins to flow out of a 1-cm radius hole at a speed of 17 m/s.  If the tower has a radius of 4 meters, speed that the water level drops?
\vspace{1.2in}

\item A fuel line in a car has a radius of 0.635 cm.  The gasoline flows to a fuel injector that has an opening of 0.00045 cm in radius.  If the fuel travels at 0.004 m/s in the fuel line, how fast does it come out of the injector opening?
\vspace{1.2in}

\item Water flows at a speed of 3 m/s in a hose of radius 1 cm.  You want the water to go farther, so you place your thumb over the end of the hose.  If the water comes out at 15 m/s, what is the effective radius of the hole where the water comes out?  (Assume the hole is circular)
\vspace{1.2in}

\item A sprinkler system has 6 sprinklers connected to a 1.27cm radius pipe.  Each sprinkler has a 2mm opening from which water sprays.  If the speed of the water coming out of the opening is 15m/s, what is the speed of the water in the pipe?  
\vspace{1.2in}

\item A water line with an internal radius of 6.5 × 10\textsuperscript{-3} m is connected to a shower head that has 12 holes. The speed of the water in the line is 1.2 m/s.  At what speed does the water leave one of the holes (effective hole radius = 4.6 × 10\textsuperscript{-4} m) in the shower head? 
\vspace{1.2in}

\item Water is exiting a garden hose (r=1.25 cm) at a speed of 2 m/s.  The garden hose is held horizontally, at a height of 4.9 meters above the ground.  
	\begin{enumerate} 
		\item Calculate the time it takes for the water to fall to the ground. 
		\vspace{1in}
		\item You wish to water a plant that is 7 meters away from the hose (horizontally). 
		\vspace{1in}
	    \item What is the speed the water would need to fall at the base of the plant?
	    \vspace{1in}
		\item You put your thumb over the hose to cause the water to travel faster.  What radius should the exit-hole of the hose be in order for the water to reach the plant? (Assume the exit-hole is circular).
