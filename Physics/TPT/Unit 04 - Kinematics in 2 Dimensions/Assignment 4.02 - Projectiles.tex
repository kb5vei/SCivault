\begin{enumerate}

\item A cannon is placed on level ground.  It is aimed 25 degrees above horizontal.   The cannonball leaves the cannon with an initial speed of 300 m/s.  
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the horizontal component of the initial velocity ($v_{ix}$)?
	\vspace{0.5in}
	\item What is the vertical component of the initial velocity ($v_{iy}$)?
	\vspace{0.5in}
	\item What is the time it takes for the cannonball to reach its maximum height?	
	\vspace{0.5in}
	\item What is the maximum height of the cannonball?
	\vspace{0.5in}
	\item What is the total time of flight for the cannonball?
	\vspace{0.5in}
	\item How far from the cannon does the cannonball land? 
		\vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}

\item A golfer hits a ball on a level golf-course at 35 m/s, 45$\degree$ above horizontal.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the amount of time it takes the golf-ball to reach its maximum height (hint: find $v_{ix}$ and $v_{iy}$ first).
	\vspace{0.55in}
	\item What is the total time the golf ball is in the air?
	\vspace{0.55in}
	\item How far away does the golf ball land?
	\vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}

\item Kay is attempting to kick a football through the field-goal posts.  She kicks the ball at 18 m/s at a 45$\degree$ angle to the ground.  She is 20 meters from the goal-post.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What are the initial vertical and horizontal velocities of the football?
	\vspace{0.6in}
	\item How long does it take the football to travel the distance to the goal post?  (Hint â€“ does this depend on the vertical direction or the horizontal direction?)
	\vspace{0.6in}
	\item What is the height of the football when it passes the goal-post?
	\vspace{0.6in}
	\item Assuming the football is kicked straight, does she score 3 points for her team?
	\vspace{0.6in}
\end{enumerate}


\item Briana is hunting wild turkeys.  She sees a turkey sitting on a branch at the top of a tree that is 35 meters away.  She aims her bow at a 25\degree angle, and shoots the arrow with a speed of 65 m/s.  The turkey is hit, and falls to the ground.  Briana picks up the turkey and takes it home to save for thanksgiving dinner.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What are the initial vertical and horizontal velocities of the arrow?
	\vspace{0.6in}
	\item How long does it take for the arrow to hit the turkey?
	\vspace{0.6in}
	\item How high up was the turkey sitting?
	\vspace{0.6in}
	\item{How long does the turkey take to fall to the ground?}
