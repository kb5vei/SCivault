\end{center}





\begin{enumerate}

\item You throw a rock at 18 m/s directly toward the horizon while standing at the edge of a 25 meter tall cliff.  
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How long does it take the rock to hit the ground?
	
	\color{red} Using Downward as Positive: $d_y = \cancelto{0}{v_{iy}t} + \frac{1}{2}a_yt^2 \longrightarrow  t = \sqrt{\frac{2d_y}{a_y}}  = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 25 m}{9.81 m/s^2}} \approx 2.258 s $ 
	
	\vspace{0.15in}
	\color{black}
	\item How far does the rock land from the bottom of the cliff?

	\color{red}
		$d_x = {v_{ix}t} + \cancelto{0}{\frac{1}{2}a_x t^2} = 18 m/s \times 2.258s \approx 40.637m $
	
	\vspace{0.15in}
	\color{black}
	
	\item What is the speed that the rock hits the ground at?	

	\color{red}
	In the X-Direction: $ v_{fx} = v_{ix} + \cancelto{0}{a_x t} = 18 m/s$
	
	In the Y-Direction: $ v_{fy} = \cancelto{0}{v_{iy}} + a_y t = 9.81 m/s \times 2.258s \approx 22.147 m/s$
	
 $ {v_f}^2 = {v_{fx}}^2 + {v_{fy}}^2 \longrightarrow {v_f} = \sqrt{{v_{fx}}^2 + {v_{fy}}^2} = \sqrt{(18 m/s)^2 + (22.147 m/s)^2} \approx 28.539 m/s  $
	
	\color{black}
	\item What is the angle of impact of the rock?
		\vspace{.1in}
		
	\color{red}
	$tan(\theta) = \frac{opp}{adj} \longrightarrow \theta = tan^{-1}(\frac{opp}{adj}) = tan^{-1}(\frac{v_{fy}}{v_{fx}}) =  tan^{-1}(\frac{22.147 m/s}{18 m/s}) \approx 50.9 \degree  $

\end{enumerate}

\item A soldier is practicing at the shooting range. The target is 23 meters away.  His rifle has a muzzle-speed of 150 m/s and it is perfectly level with the ground.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How long does it take the bullet to hit the target?
	\vspace{0.5in}
	\item How far does the bullet drop during this time?
	\vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}

\item  A pitcher throws a curve-ball at 20 m/s toward home plate, perfectly horizontal.  The ball leaves his hand 1.5 meters above the ground.  
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How far does the ball go?
	\vspace{0.5in}
	\item With what velocity (magnitude and direction) does the ball hit the ground?
	\vspace{0.7in}
\end{enumerate}


\item A cannon is placed on a wall, 25 meters above the surrounding area.  The cannon shoots cannonballs at a speed of 350 m/s, and is aimed at the horizon.  
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the distance that the cannonball travels?
	\vspace{0.5in}
	\item What is the speed that the cannonball hits the ground with?
	\vspace{0.5in}
	\item What is the angle of impact for the cannonball?	
	\vspace{0.5in}
\end{enumerate}


\item Billy-Bob rolls a bowling ball off a 35-meter high cliff.  The ball lands 15 meters away from the bottom of the cliff.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the amount of time it takes the ball to hit the ground?
	\vspace{0.6in}
	\item What is the initial velocity of the ball?
	\vspace{0.6in} 
	\item What is the final velocity of the ball (speed and direction)?
	\vspace{0.6in} 
\end{enumerate}



\item You are attempting to drive your car over a 2.25-meter wide gap in the road.  If both sides of the road are at the same height, are are perfectly level, how fast would you need to go in order to make it across?
