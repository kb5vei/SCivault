\begin{enumerate}
	\item You step off the 5-m high-dive into a pool.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How long does it take you to hit the water?
		\vspace{0.4in}
		\item What is the speed that you hit the water at?
		\vspace{0.4in}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Ashley drops a rock off of a bridge.  It takes the rock 4.81 seconds to hit the ground.  How tall is the bridge?  
	\vspace{0.4in}
	
	\item A monkey is on the ground.  He jumps at a velocity of 10 m/s directly up.  
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is the time that it takes the monkey to reach the top his jump?
		\vspace{0.5in}
		\item How high does he jump?
		\vspace{0.5in}
		\item What is the total time that the monkey was in the air?
		\vspace{0.4in}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item A man stands on top of a building.  He throws a rock at a speed of 25 m/s directly up.  The distance from the ground to the point where the rock was thrown is 25 meters.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How long does it take for the rock to reach the top of its trajectory?
		\vspace{0.4in}
		\item How high (measured from the man) does the rock go?
		\vspace{0.4in}
		\item The rock then falls to the ground.  How long does the rock take to reach the ground?
		\vspace{0.4in}
		\item How fast is the rock going when it hits the ground?
			\vspace{0.4in}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item A volcano is 1,250 m taller than the surrounding land.  During an eruption, a rock is shot out of the volcano directly up at a speed of 475 m/s.  
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How high does the rock go?
		\vspace{1in}
		\item As the rock is in the air, the volcano blows itself apart.  The rock lands at the same height as the surrounding land.  What is the speed that the rock is going when it hits the ground? (Ignore air resistance).
		\vspace{1in}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item A baseball player hits a foul ball into the stands behind home plate.  If the ball left his bat with a vertical velocity of 22.5 m/s, 
	
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is the greatest height that the ball will reach?
		\vspace{1in}
		\item If the stands are 4 meters higher than the baseball player, what is the total amount of time it takes from when he hits the ball until the baseball lands in the stands?
		\vspace{1in}
		\item What is the velocity of the baseball when it is caught by an adoring fan?
