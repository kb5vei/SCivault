\begin{center} Assignment 2.03 - The Definition of Acceleration
\end{center}





\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the definition of acceleration (in equation form)?  Explain the difference between velocity and acceleration.  
\vspace{1in}
\item A car starts from a stop at a traffic light that has just turned green.  The car accelerates at a rate of 3 m/s\textsuperscript{2}.  How fast is the car traveling after 5 seconds?
\vspace{1in}
\item You are riding your bike at a speed of 4 m/s when you see a large dog behind you.  In an effort to outrun the dog, you accelerate to 20 m/s over the course of the next 8 seconds.  What was your rate of acceleration?
\vspace{1in}
\item You are skydiving, and are falling at your terminal velocity of 60 m/s.  You pull your parachute, and decelerate to a speed of 10 m/s, at a rate of 5 m/s\textsuperscript{2}.  How long did it take you to reach your final velocity?

\item A car is driving on Lee Trevino at 20 m/s when the driver sees a red light.  The driver slows the car to a stop over the next 8 seconds.  What is the acceleration of the car?
\vspace{1.5in}
\item Lauren is walking at 2 m/s when she is startled by Benny walking behind her. Over the next two seconds, she starts to run at 6 m/s. What was her acceleration?
\vspace{1in}
\item A plane is traveling 250 m/s when it touches down on the runway while landing.  It comes to a complete stop in 25 seconds.  What is the acceleration of the plane?
\vspace{1in}
\item Elijah is driving a car with a top acceleration of 12 m/s\textsuperscript{2}.  If he starts from a stop, and accelerates for 3 seconds, what is the speed his car will be going?
\vspace{1in}
\item Celina is marching forward at a speed of 1 m/s when she starts to march backward at a speed of 2 m/s.  If she accelerates at 12 m/s\textsuperscript{2}, how much time will the change take?
\vspace{1in}
\item A car is advertised to go from “0 to 60 mph [26.822 m/s] in 5.7 seconds.”  What is the acceleration of the car?
