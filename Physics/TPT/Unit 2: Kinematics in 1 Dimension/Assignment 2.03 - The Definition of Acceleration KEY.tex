\begin{center} Assignment 2.03 - The Definition of Acceleration KEY
\end{center}





\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the definition of acceleration (in equation form)?  Explain the difference between velocity and acceleration.  

	\color{red}
	\begin{center} $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t}$
		\vspace{0.15in}
		
			Velocity is how fast something is moving and in what direction.  Acceleration measures how its velocity is changing. (Speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction.)
		
	\end{center}

\item A car starts from a stop at a traffic light that has just turned green.  The car accelerates at a rate of 3 m/s\textsuperscript{2}.  How fast is the car traveling after 5 seconds?

	
	\color{red}
	\begin{center} $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t} \Longrightarrow v_f = v_i + a t =  0 m/s + 3 m/s^2 \cdot 5s = 15 m/s $
		\vspace{0.15in}
		
	
	\end{center}

\item You are riding your bike at a speed of 4 m/s when you see a large dog behind you.  In an effort to outrun the dog, you accelerate to 20 m/s over the course of the next 8 seconds.  What was your rate of acceleration?
	
	\color{red}
	\begin{center} $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t} = \frac{20m/s-4m/s}{8s} = 2 m/s^2
		\vspace{0.15in} $
	\end{center}
	\color{black}

\item You are skydiving, and are falling at your terminal velocity of 60 m/s.  You pull your parachute, and decelerate to a speed of 10 m/s, at a rate of 5 m/s\textsuperscript{2}.  How long did it take you to reach your final velocity? 	\color{red} Note: Acceleration is negative because it is opposite the direction of motion. 
		

	\begin{center} $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t} \Longrightarrow \Delta t = \frac{v_f - v_i}{a} = \frac{10m/s-60m/s}{-5m/s^2} = 10s
		\vspace{0.15in} $
	\end{center}
	\color{black}


\item A car is driving on Lee Trevino at 20 m/s when the driver sees a red light.  The driver slows the car to a stop over the next 8 seconds.  What is the acceleration of the car?

		\vspace{0.15in}
		\color{red}
	\begin{center} $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t} = \frac{0m/s-20m/s}{8s} = -2.5 m/s^2
		\vspace{0.95in} $
	\end{center}
	\color{black}



\item Lauren is walking at 2 m/s when she is startled by Benny walking behind her. Over the next two seconds, she starts to run at 6 m/s. What was her acceleration?
	
	\color{red}
	\begin{center} $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t} = \frac{6m/s-2m/s}{2s} = 2 m/s^2
		\vspace{0.15in} $
	\end{center}
	\color{black}

\item A plane is traveling 250 m/s when it touches down on the runway while landing.  It comes to a complete stop in 25 seconds.  What is the acceleration of the plane?

		
	\color{red}
	\begin{center} $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t} = \frac{0m/s-250m/s}{25s} = -10 m/s^2
		\vspace{0.15in} $
	\end{center}
	\color{black}
	
	


\item Elijah is driving a car with a top acceleration of 12 m/s\textsuperscript{2}.  If he starts from a stop, and accelerates for 3 seconds, what is the speed his car will be going?

		\vspace{0.15in}
		\color{red}
	\begin{center} $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t} \Longrightarrow
		v_f = v_i + a t = 0 m/s + (12 m/s^2) (3s) = 36 m/s
		\vspace{0.15in} $
	\end{center}
	\color{black}
	

\item Celina is marching forward at a speed of 1 m/s when she starts to march backward at a speed of 2 m/s.  If she accelerates at 12 m/s\textsuperscript{2}, how much time will the change take? \color{red} Note: Backward speed is negative.  To accelerate backward, acceleration must be negative as well.

			
			\vspace{0.15in}
	\begin{center} $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t} \Longrightarrow \Delta t = \frac{v_f - v_i}{a} = \frac{-2m/s-1m/s}{-12m/s^2} = 0.25s
		\vspace{0.15in} $
	\end{center}
	\color{black}



\item A car is advertised to go from “0 to 60 mph [26.822 m/s] in 5.7 seconds.”  What is the acceleration of the car?

	\color{red}
	\begin{center} $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } = \frac{v_f - v_i}{\Delta t} = \frac{26.822m/s-0m/s}{5.7s} \approx 4.706 m/s^2
	\vspace{0.15in} $
	\end{center}
	\color{black}
