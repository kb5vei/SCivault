\begin{enumerate}
\item You are in a plane that is taking off.  It starts from a stop and accelerates at a rate of 5 m/s\textsuperscript{2} until it leaves the ground 675 meters away.  
	\begin{enumerate} 
		\item What is the velocity that the plane is traveling with when it leaves the ground? 
		\vspace{.75in}
		\item How long does it take the plane to travel the distance of the runway?
		\vspace{.75in}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item A cart is rolling down an inclined plane, and accelerates from rest at a constant rate of 0.5 m/s\textsuperscript{2}. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How far will the cart travel in 0.75 seconds?
		\vspace{.75in}
		\item What is the final velocity of the cart after 0.75 seconds?
		\vspace{.75in}		
	\end{enumerate}
	\item A major league pitcher can cause a baseball to go from 0 m/s to 42 m/s over the distance of 1.2 meters.  
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Calculate the acceleration of the baseball.
		\vspace{.75in}
		\item How long does it take the pitcher to throw the ball (from when he starts to throw until the ball leaves his hand)?
		\vspace{.75in}
	\end{enumerate}




	\item The Space Shuttle Discovery begins its final launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.  At t=0s, the main engines start, and Discovery climbs toward the sky.  10 minutes later, Discovery is traveling 7.823 x 10\textsuperscript{3} m/s.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is Discovery's average acceleration?
		\vspace{.75in}
		\item How far does Discovery travel during this time? 
		\vspace{.75in}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Kirk and McCoy step off the edge of a 50-m high cliff on an alien planet.  If gravity causes them to accelerate at 2.3 m/s\textsuperscript{2},
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is their speed when they hit the water below?
		\vspace{.75in}
		\item How long are they falling toward the water?
		\vspace{.75in}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item A man is pushing a baby stroller on a hill when he is distracted by a text message.  Starting from rest, the baby stroller begins to roll down the hill, accelerating at 0.1 m/s\textsuperscript{2}.  If the man can run at a speed of 12 m/s, what is the longest amount of time he can spend reading his text message and still catch the stroller?
