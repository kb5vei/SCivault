\begin{center}Things to Memorize: Newton's Laws
\end{center}


\subsection*{Force}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textbf{Force} is push or a pull on something. 
	\item Force is a Vector.  It is symbolized by the symbol $\vec{F}$
	\item Force is measured in kg m/s\textsuperscript{2}.  This is often abbreviated as N (newtons).  
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Newton's First Law}
\begin{center}
	\textit{Objects in motion will stay in motion and objects at rest will stay at rest until acted on by an external, unbalanced force.}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
	\item This means that if there are no forces acting on an object, it will continue to move in the same way it was moving initially - either at rest or in a straight line at a constant speed.
	\item In order for an object to remain at rest, all the forces must be balanced.
	\item In order for an object to travel with constant velocity, all the forces must be balanced.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Newton's Second Law}
\begin{center}
	\textit{The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.}
\end{center}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item This is often written as a formula: $ \Sigma\vec{F} = m \vec{a}$ or $ \vec{F_{net}} = m \vec{a}$
	\item If an object is accelerating, there must be at least one unbalanced force acting on the object. 
	\item The first law is just a special case of the second law: If the net force acting on an object is zero, its acceleration will be zero. 
\end{itemize}





 

\subsection*{Newton's Third Law}
\begin{center}
	\textit{For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The action and reaction pairs are always simultaneous.
	\item The action and reaction pairs are always the same in magnitude.
	\item The action and reaction paris are always in opposite directions.
	
\end{itemize}
