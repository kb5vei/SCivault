\item A 600 kg car accelerates from 5 m/s to 10 m/s in three seconds.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the acceleration of the car?
	\vspace{0.4in}
	\item What is the force that the motor exerts on the car?
	\vspace{0.4in}
\end{enumerate}

\item Two children are playing tug-o-war.  Juan has a mass of 40 kg and pulls with a force of 20 N. Carlos has a mass of 20 kg and pulls with a force of 50 N.  
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Which way do the children go?
	\vspace{0.3in}
	\item What is the acceleration of the children?
	\vspace{0.4in}
	\item How far do they end up after 10 seconds?  
	\vspace{0.4in}
\end{enumerate}

\item  A pitcher throws a curve-ball at 20 m/s toward home plate, perfectly horizontal.  The ball leaves his hand 1.5 meters above the ground.  
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How far does the ball go?
	\vspace{0.4in}
	\item With what velocity (magnitude and direction) does the ball hit the ground?
	\vspace{0.4in}
\end{enumerate}


\item A car has a mass of 850 kg.  What is the weight of the car?

\item A crane lifts a 1200 kg steel girder.  It causes the girder to accelerate at a rate of 0.2 m/s\textsuperscript{2} upward. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What force must the crane exert on the steel girder?
	\vspace{0.4in}
	\item How long does it take the crane to reach its top speed of 3 m/s?

\end{enumerate}

\item You push a box across the floor with a force of 60 newtons for two seconds.  The force of friction on the box is 20 newtons.  The box has a mass of 40 kg.  
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the acceleration of the box?
	\vspace{0.4in}
	\item What is the speed of the box when you stop pushing it?
	\vspace{0.4in}
	\item What is the deceleration of the box when you stop pushing it?
	\vspace{0.4in}
	\item How long does it take the box to come to a complete stop?
	\vspace{0.4in}
	\item What is the final position of the box?
