\begin{center} Growth vs Fixed Mindset Survey
\end{center}

\textit{Rank each statement from 1-(Strongly Disagree) to 5-(Strongly Agree)}



\begin{enumerate}


	
	\item \rule{.5in}{.01in} There are some things I'm just not good at.
	\item \rule{.5in}{.01in} People are born with a certain amount of intelligence, and that can't be changed.
	\item \rule{.5in}{.01in} Natural ability is more important than the amount of time one spends practicing.
	\item \rule{.5in}{.01in} Dealing with someone who is smarter than me makes me feel nervous.
	\item \rule{.5in}{.01in} I like easy assignment better than challenging ones.
	\item \rule{.5in}{.01in} It's more important to look smart than it is to actually be smart.
	\item \rule{.5in}{.01in} Its better to ignore negative comments about something I have done.
	\item \rule{.5in}{.01in} I would rather succeed at an easy task than take on a challenging project and fail.
	\item \rule{.5in}{.01in} When I am criticized, I feel the need to defend myself or make excuses.
	\item \rule{.5in}{.01in} Don't ever confront your boss.  You need the job more than they need you.
	
\end{enumerate}
 
Total: \rule{.5in}{.01in}
\vspace{.5in}

\textit{Your total can range from 10 to 50.  Scores less than 20 indicates a strong growth mindset whereas scores greater than 40 indicate a strong fixed mindset. Scores between 20 and 40 indicate a combination of the two mindsets.}
