 \textit{Mark each question as either TRUE or FALSE}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [\rule{0.4in}{0.01in} 1.]Often, I learn better on my own than in groups.  
    \item [\rule{0.4in}{0.01in} 2.]I usually work harder than my peers.
    \item [\rule{0.4in}{0.01in} 3.]I care more about the people around me than I do about myself.
    \item [\rule{0.4in}{0.01in} 4.]I am not satisfied until I complete something I start.
    \item [\rule{0.4in}{0.01in} 5.]I prefer advanced classes (Pre-AP, AP, IB, Dual-Credit, etc.) to regular classes because of the students that make up advanced classes.
    \item [\rule{0.4in}{0.01in} 6.]I cannot stand things that are messy.
    \item [\rule{0.4in}{0.01in} 7.]People have often described me as curious.
    \item [\rule{0.4in}{0.01in} 8.]I write lists of things I need to accomplish.
    \item [\rule{0.4in}{0.01in} 9.]I would rather have one great friend than five decent ones.
    \item [\rule{0.3in}{0.01in} 10.]When I fail it just makes me try harder.
    \item [\rule{0.3in}{0.01in} 11.]I can think of at least three pages of text or music that I can close my eyes and visualize in my head.
    \item [\rule{0.3in}{0.01in} 12.]I have trouble falling asleep at night because my mind is still thinking about things.
    \item [\rule{0.3in}{0.01in} 13.]I am usually able to quickly identify and eliminate useless information in a problem.
    \item [\rule{0.3in}{0.01in} 14.]If I finish an assignment before it is due, I will keep it and possibly make changes until it is due.
    \item [\rule{0.3in}{0.01in} 15.]Sometimes, I go to bed not knowing the answer to a problem, and wake up knowing the solution.
    \item [\rule{0.3in}{0.01in} 16.]I wish the day was longer so that I would have more time to do all the things I need to do.
    \item [\rule{0.3in}{0.01in} 17.]A teacher assigns 20 homework problems, but says he will not grade them.  Instead, he will be giving a quiz that contains problems similar to the ones on the homework.  I only do between 5 and 10 of them, until I am sure I understand the concepts.
    \item [\rule{0.3in}{0.01in} 18.]I understand the small details of my classes, but often lose sight of the ``Big Picture."

\textit{T-score and P-score can range from -15 to 15.  \textbf{T-Score} tells you about your natural talent. \textbf{P-Score} tells you about your Perseverance.}
\end{center}


T-Score (True Odd - False Odd): \rule{0.5in}{0.01in}

\vspace{.5in}
P-Score (True Even - False Even): \rule{0.5in}{0.01in}
\vspace{.25in}

\textbf{P-Score} tends to be a better predictor of academic success than \textbf{T-Score}.  Many top-ten students in high schools around the country have a very high \textbf{P-Score}.  Additionally, students involved in programs that require self-discipline (Sports, Martial Arts, Marching Band, etc.) tend to have higher \textbf{P-Score}s.  

Students with very high \textbf{T-Score}s can become bored easily and appreciate tasks that require non-routine thinking.  These students can often rely on their talents to meet expectations. Many students who are gifted have high \textbf{T-Score}s.
