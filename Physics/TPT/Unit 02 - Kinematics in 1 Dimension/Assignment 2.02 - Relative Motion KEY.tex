\begin{enumerate}
\item George is riding his bicycle to the east at 10 m/s.  There is a car, 100 meters away, coming toward him at 30 m/s.  How long does George have to react in order to avoid a collision?
\color{red}
\begin{center} $ v_{relative} = v_{bicycle} + v_{car} = 10 m/s + 30 m/s = 40 m/s $
	\vspace{0.15in}
	
$	v = \frac{d}{t} \Longrightarrow t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{100m}{40 m/s} = 2.5 s $

\item Monique leaves her house and walks to school at a rate of 1.5 m/s.  At the same time, Rick leaves the school and walks toward Monique's house at a speed of 2 m/s.  Monique's house is 1200 meters from the school.
\begin{enumerate} \item How long does it take for Monique and Rick to meet?

	\color{red}
	\begin{center} $ v_{relative} = v_{Monique} + v_{Rick} = 1.5 m/s + 2 m/s = 3.5 m/s $
		
		\vspace{0.15in}
		$	v = \frac{d}{t} \Longrightarrow t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{1200m}{3.5 m/s} \approx 342.857s \approx $  5 min 42.857s
		
	\end{center}
	

	\color{black}
	
	\item How far from Monique's house do they meet?
	
	
\end{enumerate}

\color{red}
\begin{center}	
	$ v = \frac{d}{t} \Longrightarrow d = v \times t = 1.5 m/s * 342.857s \approx 514.286 m $

\item Ernest, a police officer, is in pursuit of a car that has been stolen by the notorius criminal Bert.  Bert is 5 km ahead of the police car.  Bert drives 30 m/s, and the Ernest is catching up by driving 45 m/s. \color{red} *Note: 5 km = 5000 m \color{black}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How long does it take for Ernest to catch up?
			\color{red}
		\begin{center} $ v_{relative} = v_{Ernest} - v_{Bert} = 45 m/s - 30 m/s = 15 m/s $
			
			\vspace{0.15in}
			$	v = \frac{d}{t} \Longrightarrow d = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{5000m}{15 m/s} \approx 333.333s \approx $  5 min 33.333s
			
		\end{center}
		\color{black}
		
	\item How far does the Bert drive during that time?
	
	\color{red}
	\begin{center}	
		$ v = \frac{d}{t} \Longrightarrow d = v \times t = 45 m/s * 333.333s \approx 15000 m = 15 km $
		\vspace{0.15in}

	\item A car, coming from the other direction, driven by an innocent bystander named Zoey, is traveling 20 m/s.  How fast does she see the thief go by?
\end{enumerate}

\color{red}
\begin{center} $ v_{relative} = v_{Zoey} + v_{Bert} = 20 m/s + 30 m/s = 50 m/s $
	
\end{center}

\item Billy-Bob is flying 100 m/s in a plane directly above a road.  He sees a car driving in the same direction, 550 meters in front of him.  It takes the plane 7.25 seconds to pass the car.  How fast is the car driving? \color{red} *Note: There are multiple correct ways to solve this problem.  

\begin{center} $v_{relative}= \frac{d}{t} = \frac{550m}{7.25s} \approx 75.826 m/s $
	
	$ v_{relative} = v_{plane} - v_{car} \Longrightarrow v_{car} = v_{plane} - v_{relative}  = 100m/s - 75.862 m/s \approx 24.138 m/s $
	
\end{center}

\item Louis is in a fighter plane, chasing an imperial Zero fighter near Hawaii.  He is flying 60 m/s, and his guns have a forward velocity of 300 m/s.  He fires a single shot at the fighter, which is 450 m away.  The Zero fighter is fleeing at a speed of 95 m/s.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the speed of his bullet, as measured by an observer on the ground?
	
	\color{red}
	\begin{center} 	$ v_{relative-to-ground} = v_{Louis} + v_{bullet} = 60 m/s + 300 m/s = 360 m/s $
		
	\end{center}
	\vspace {.15in}
	\color{black}
	
	\item What speed does the pilot of the Zero fighter see the bullet coming toward him at?
		\color{red}
			\vspace {.15in}
	\begin{center} 	$ v_{relative-to-zero} = v_{relative-to-ground} - v_{zero} = 360 m/s - 95 m/s = 265 m/s $
		
	\end{center}
	\vspace {.15in}
	\color{black}
	
	
	
	
	\item How long does it take for the bullet to hit the imperial fighter?
		\color{red}
\vspace {.15in}
\begin{center} 	$ v_{relative-to-zero} = \frac{d}{t} \Longrightarrow t =  \frac{d}{v_{relative-to-zero}} = \frac{550m}{265m/s} \approx 2.075s $
	
\end{center}
\vspace {.15in}
\color{black}


	\item What is the total distance that the bullet travels?
	
		\color{red}
	\vspace {.15in}
	\begin{center} 	$ v_{relative-to-ground} = \frac{d}{t} \Longrightarrow d =  v_{relative-to-ground} \times t = 360 m/s * 2.075s  \approx  747.170 m $

	\item What is the date that these events took place?

\item Salma is swimming 40m west of the shore when she sees a shark 78m west of her.  She attempts to swim to the shore at a speed of 4 m/s.  The shark pursues her at a speed of 12 m/s.  Does Salma make it to the shore safely? 
\begin{multicols}{2} 
	
	

	
\color{red}
\begin{center} 	
	Salma:
	
	$v = \frac{d}{t} \Longrightarrow t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac {40m}{4 m/s} = 10 s$ 
	
		Shark:
	
	$v = \frac{d}{t} \Longrightarrow t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac {118m}{12 m/s} \approx 9.833 s$
