Version 0.0.1

This is the Scivault Curriculum.

Currently it only includes resources for Physics, but eventually, it may include many other High-School Subjects,
Such as Biology, Chemistry, Integrated Physics and Chemistry (aka IPC, Physical Science) and Astronomy.

Why is this curriculum necessary?
Most curriculum packages have serious defects to them.  Common Problems include:
	Not being fully editable
	Requiring Internet Access
	Not Platform-Independent (sometimes requiring use of proprietary software as well)
	Lack of Rigor, Relavance, or Specificity
	Obsolete Information (A commonly heard example is "Our textbook still lists pluto as a planet!"
In contrast, this curriculum package is designed with the following principles in mind:
-Platform Independence
	All documents are written in Open formats, readable from many free, open-source office programs, such as LibreOffice.
	These documents are also readable in many versions of Microsoft Office.  
-Accessibility, both online and off
	Once the Curriculum Package is downloaded, no network connection is needed, and no special software must be installed.
-Editability
	All documents are easily modified.  This allows simple differentiation to meet various learners' needs.
-Accuracy
	The most accurate scientific information availible is used to develop this.  Students will learn to evaluate their
	answers for reasonability.  There will be no references to 500-kilogram children, nor will trucks drive faster than
	the speed of light.  
-Specificity
	Many textbooks and curriculum packages confuse ambiguity in a question for "higher level questioning." Other times, 
	concepts that are not related to the specific lesson are evaluated in a misguided attempt to increase rigor.
	Both of these situations hinder the instuctor's ability to evaluate the students' understanding of the material.
	This curriculum attempts to ask specific questions about the concept being taught, while still developing
	critical thinking skills.

-Rigor and Relavance
-SI System

Integrity - No Solutions Provided
In order to preserve the integrity of this curriculum, no solution guides, teacher's editions, or answer keys will be
provided to any one, at any time, for any reason.  Please refrain from posting solutions online without some kind of 
authentication (such as a password)  If you wish students to have solutions to any questions contained herein,
you may provide them with hard-copies or post solutions to a secured website requiring a password that is not easily 
guessed.  The 4-year cycle should be long enough to preserve integrity of the assignments in most situations 
(most students who take physics will have graduated before the same set of questions recurs.)
